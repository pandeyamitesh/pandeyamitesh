Hi! I'm Amitesh (अमितेश, /ə.mɪ.t̪eːʃ/), a sophomore at [Caltech](https://caltech.edu){:target="_blank"}, studying computer and information science. My research interests lie at the intersection of causal inference and ml/ai to better model our physical world. I hope to improve existing machine learning models of our natural and urban systems by informing them of underlying causality and vice-versa. 

Keywords: `ml/ai for science` `causal inference` `natural and urban systems`

Previously, I worked at the [Reisman Chemical Synthesis Group](https://cce.caltech.edu/people/sarah-e-reisman){:target="_blank"} where I explored supervised machine learning methods and graph neural networks to forecast regioselectivity in the C-H bond's functionalization for improved industrial production of phenazines. I presented my work as a poster at the Caltech summer research symposium and was awarded the John Stauffer award to pursue this work. 

I have also been involved with the MIT PatchCheck Foundation, working with [Ramesh Raskar](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/raskar/overview/){:target="_blank"} of the MIT Media Lab, where my work was centered around exploring methods to posit statistics and ml-aware COVID-19 vaccination policies. I have also spent a summer researching optimization and genetic algorithms at the [Bulgarian Academy of Sciences](https://www.proceedings.bas.bg/index.php/cr){:target="_blank"}.

In my free time, I like to lift weights, run long-distance, and read books.
